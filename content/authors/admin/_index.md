Dr Xinghu Qin is an Associate Professor at School of Ecology and Natural Conservation, Beijing Forestry University. His interest lies in the intersection of ecology, genetics and evolution where he uses cutting edge technologies to better understand the origin, development and maintenance of genetic and phenotypic variation. 
His researches focus on how does environment drive biodiversity (genetic variations, phenotypic variations, and species) from genes to ecosystems; and how do genes and environment jointly shape the phenotypic traits. Recently, he combines principles from statistical inference, machine learning, and causal reasoning to decode large and high-dimensional genomic data to (1) visualize geographic genetic variations, (2) detect signatures of natural selection and (3) identify trait signatures and pinpoint causal drivers. 

In addition, Xinghu is also interested in using multi-omics profiling methods in single cells and applying spatial omics to a variety of questions in fundamental biology. With the advance of new sequencing technologies, large and complex genome-wide variation data (such as single-cell genomes/transcriptomes, epigenetic profiles, etc.) is difficult to mine if applications of different cases require different model assumptions. Instead, the design of modern genomic tools should be able to provide a generalized framework that can adopt various genetic variation data or data types, allowing detecting unanticipated relationships with phenotypes and environment. Machine learning has the potential to achieve this by unifying and learning the vast and diverse omics data, such as RNA, epigenetic profiles, proteomic profiles, SNPs, and structural variations, thus enhancing the data solidity to build the multi-omics based, genome-wide associations to study adaptive or trait-related genes.
