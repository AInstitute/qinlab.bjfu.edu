title: Inference of the demographic history and migration pattern of Oedaleus
  asiaticus using machine learning
date: 2023-10-13T14:58:15.123Z
summary: The outbreak of Oedaleus asiaticus Bey-Bienko has caused serious damage
  to agricultural and pastoral production in China. However, Oedaleus decorus
  Germar, the subspecies of O.asiaticus that is widely distributed in Europe,
  rarely outbreaks. The evolutionary genetic mechanism behind the geographical
  origin and outbreak differences of these two subspecies (O. asiaticus and O.
  decorus) are still not clear. Based on our previous studies, we will perform
  the Reduced-Representation Sequencing on the European population, Mongolian
  population, and Inner Mongolia population of these two Oedaleus. We aim to (1)
  investigate the geographical origin of Oedaleus, and build the
  molecularmonitoring technology based on machine learning to reveal the oversea
  sources and migratory paths of O. asiaticus in the Inner Mongolia grasslands;
  (2) analyze the evolutionary history, including the historical effective
  population size, migration, dispersal history, as well as genetic divergence
  patterns; (3) uncover the genetic and evolutionary basis of plague difference
  for O. asiaticus in different geographical regions. This project is of great
  significance in clarifying the geographical origin and adaptive genetic
  differentiation of O.asiaticus, and provides a scientific basis for monitoring
  and early warning,identification of outbreak source as well as proposal of
  effective prevention and control measures for O. asiaticus. Meanwhile, it will
  provide a new research paradigm for the origin, migration and outbreak
  mechanism of major pests.
