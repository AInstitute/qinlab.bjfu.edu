abstract: "Landscape diversity is one of the key drivers for maintaining
  ecosystem services in agricultural production by providing vital habitats and
  alternative food sources for beneficial insects and pollinators within the
  agricultural landscapes. The landscape structure, land uses and diversity
  differ between geographic locations. However, how the changes of landscape
  structure and land use diversity affect the arthropod diversity in a
  geographic area is poorly understood. Here we tested the the impact of
  landscape diversity on the rice farmland arthropod diversity in three
  geographic locations of Bangladesh. The landscape in Chattogram has
  intensified with mixed nature and land use mix (LUM) shows highly diversified
  to very highly diversity (>7.9). But this landscape is modified in Satkhira
  and visualized in LUM index where 80% grids under highly diversified
  (0.59–0.79) and landscape changes in Patuakhali portrayed the LUM index from
  moderately (0.39–0.59) to less diversified (0.19–0.39). These significant
  different landscape diversities influenced the arthropod diversity in rice
  field. Arthropod species diversity increases with the increasing of LUM index.
  Maximum tillering stage of rice growth harbored higher abundance and species
  diversity in rice field. Moreover, we found vegetation is the most important
  factor influencing the abundance of arthropods. Extensive agriculture and
  forest contributed substantially to predicting the arthropod richness.
  Meanwhile, barren land and high density residential as well as intensive
  agriculture had large impacts on the species diversity. "
