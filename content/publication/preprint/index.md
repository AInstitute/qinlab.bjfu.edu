abstract: Fine-scale genetic structure impacts genetic risk predictions and
  furthers the understanding of the demography of diverse population which may
  lead to health disparities in population health monitoring system.
  Epidemiology and population genetic research try to disentangle subtle genetic
  differences within a population through various dimension reduction approaches
  (i.e., PCA, DAPC, t-SNE, and UMAP). However, one undesirable aspect of these
  approaches is that they either produce coarse and ambiguous cluster divisions
  or they fail to preserve the correct genetic distance between populations. We
  proposed a new machine learning algorithm (ALFDA) for better capturing
  fine-scale genetic structure and recapitulating geogenetic distance. ALFDA
  correctly estimated the genetic affinity between individuals and keep the
  multimodal structure within populations. Through extensive simulations and
  empirical data analyses, we showed that ALFDA outperformed the other
  approaches in identifying fine-scale genetic structure and in preserving
  geogenetic distance. Notably, genetic features produced from ALFDA had highest
  correlation with F_ST under an isolation-by-distance model. We identified a
  rich pattern of subtle fine-scale genetic differentiation within diverse
  populations than those identified by existing approaches, indicating that
  genetic ancestry is more nuanced than previously reported. Our method was able
  to uncover fine-scale genetic structure within populations, which could help
  understand the genetic origin and diversity of individuals in understudied
  diverse populations thus facilitates precise health.
