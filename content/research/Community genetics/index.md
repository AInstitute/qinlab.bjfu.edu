## Community composition change and plant stoichiometric traits induced by livestock grazing and grassland management practice potentially  promote the outbreak of  locusts.

<!--more-->

The locust Oedaleus asiaticus Bey-Bienko (Acrididae: Oedipodinae) is a dominant and economically important pest that is widely distributed across the Mongolian plateau, causing major damage to the pasture productivity in China. This herbivore pest is characterised by its plastic traits-phase polyphenism, which enables this species to easily transform between non-swarming grasshoppers and swarming locusts. Our study shows that changes in small-scale plant community can significantly affect grasshoppers' traits, which potentially promote their outbreak. Furthermore, we found that the grasshopper traits are related to plant stoichiometric traits.  This study provides insight into specific mechanisms by which differences in small-scale vegetation structure affect the interactions among individuals and cause changes in their biology that impact their status as a pest. The results give us valuable information to develop guidelines for grassland management and pest control.

## Molecular Ecological Basis of Grasshopper Phenotypic Plasticity under Environmental Selection

<!--more-->

The notorious locust, O. asiaticus has demonstrated its adaptive phenotypes across the heterogeneous grassland types covering various environment on the Mongolian plateau. We uncovered environmental drivers underpinning grasshopper phenotypes (intra-specie diversity) and the associated genes regulating grasshopper's traits. Form a more technical view, we revealed eco-transcriptomic architecture (ETA) of grasshopper phenotypic traits and proved the feasibility of incorporating environmental factors, phenotypic traits and gene expression using CCA, laying the foundation for interdisciplinary research involved in RNA-Seq and ecology. For a more practical view, we uncovered the ecological and molecular basis of grasshopper phenotypic plasticity, identifying the environmental factors and candidate genes that jointly shaped the grasshopper phenotypes. This would provide guidelines for grassland management that can change the grasshopper living environment directly so that prevents its outbreak. Our findings also suggest the candidate targets that can be used to develop the pesticides.

## Uncovering Genes involved in Adaptation in Chorthippus albonemus (Orthoptera: Acrididae) Under Herbivore Grazing


<!--more-->

This study investigated two levels of variants: the species and gene expression profiles under different livestock grazing. We revealed the mechanism of biodiversity change caused by grazing, and also identified the novel genes responsible for adaptation in Chorthippus albonemus (Orthoptera: Acrididae).

In this study, we used large enclosures to study the effects of sheep grazing in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia on C. albonemus population dynamics and gene expression. We found that grazing affected habitat quality by decreasing plant abundance and quality and influencing plant succession. These effects point to resource-dependent competition explaining the unimodal disturbance-abundance dynamics with physiological compensation. Our results show that transcriptional changes in the grassland pest C. albonemus underlie its adaptation to livestock grazing.

In response to higher grazing intensity, upregulated genes included those involved in serine-type peptidase activity, anatomical structure development, and sensory organ development; downregulated genes included those involved in the structural constituents of the ribosome and ribosome processes. Genes strongly upregulated in response to heavy grazing pressure included adaptive genes such as those encoding ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein and HSP. 

The identification of differentially expressed genes involved in adaptability may provide new targets for the control of grasshopper populations to improve grassland management.
