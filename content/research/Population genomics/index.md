## Deep learning in genetics/genomics 
<!--more-->

Deep learning has shown its super power in demographic inference, especially when large number of summary statistics are involved. I created some scripts to test the performance of neural network regression and ABC in demographic inference. As expected, deep learning outperforms the traditional ABC in discriminatory power and prediction accuracy. 


## The most informative statistics for population structure inference 

<!--more-->

Information theory provides a spectrum of  information measures, which can be used to infer the signals of evolutionary changes from DNA. I tested 127 information-based statistics for population geography inference using deep learning. I identified the most informative summary statistics for population demographic inference. Results can be found here. 


## A new approach for inferring population structure and their geographic origin

<!--more-->

I proposed a new method for inferring population structure and the geographic origin of individuals. I have compared the performance with PCA, t-SNE and UMAP. Notably, my approach outperforms the current existing methods in population structure inference, especially for admixed populations with subtle structure. Tools will be available soon.
