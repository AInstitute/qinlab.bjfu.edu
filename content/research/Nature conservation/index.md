## Locust plague and the causes of locust aggregation

<!--more-->

I investigated the ecological and molecular basis of locust adaptation under the mosaic rangelands, revealing the causes of locust plague on grassland as well as the signatures underlying the local adaptation. Meanwhile, I also isolated an effective Metarhizium anisopliae, which was used to develop the biological weapon to fight locusts. Prof Zhang 's team at IPP, CAAS, has input large efforts into the development of biological control agent (BCAs). One of the famous BCA is Metarhizium anisopliae. We have isolated various varieties of fungi that can effectively kill locusts. 


## Biological weapon against locusts 
<!--more-->

I have developed several tools for locust biological control. One impressive biological control complex is the integration of two biological control agents . This integration is a "biological bullet" that have been successfully applied to control a notorious migratory locust in China. This "bullet" has successfully authorized as a National patents. Interested in knowing this mysterious weapon? See Patents:  patent licensing number: CN103783030B.

Other molecular tools were developed to detect the viability / and fitness of locusts/insects in the certain environment. Most them have been granted as the patents.

Calosoma maximoviczi Mora is a rarely exploited beetle species, which has powerful and ferocious threat to grasshopper. Photo credit to:Prof Liu Yusheng (Shandong Agricultural University) and Zhaoli (Xinjiang Agricultural University).

I raised C. maximoviczi and Carabus smaragdinus at the lab and also at my dormitory during my undergraduate (2009-2013). My colleague introduced C. maximoviczi to Xinjiang grassland and I introduced Carabus smaragdinus to Inner Mongolia grassland for controlling the grasshoppers. All these practices had substantially ecological, environmental, and economical effects and feedbacks.


## Farmer's behavior in pesticide use: Insights study from smallholder and intensive agricultural farms in Bangladesh

<!--more-->

Since independence and over the years, pesticides have become a dominant feature of Bangladesh agriculture. To protect farmers' health, environment and to improve sustainability of chemical pest control quantitative understanding of farmers' behavior in pesticide use is critical. However, study on the levels of knowledge and awareness of farmers and the practices of pesticide use are often limited. We conducted a broad analysis on the effects of knowledge and awareness of farmers as well as the influence of the different associated stakeholders such as pesticide retailers and the government, on farmers' behavior in pesticide use from a detailed survey of 917 agricultural households in different regions of Bangladesh. Within eight protective behaviors (PBs) or PPEs were largely influenced by the crops growers and regions. Never discarding empty pesticide containers in the field, never applying pesticides more than prescribed by DAE or the instruction manual, selecting new types of pesticides recommended by DAE and purchasing low toxicity pesticides were the most adopted practices. Most farmers from the South-East region were adopting the PB of wearing mask, gloves and long sleeved clothes when spraying and farmers from South trusted the recommendations of pesticides by village leaders and neighbors. Majority of vegetables growers were well informed that pesticides were very harmful to the quality of agricultural products, the environment, and human health but not rice or mixed crops growers. Generally, PBs were positively affected by the perception of the consequences of farmers' behavior and knowledge of pesticide use but negatively influenced by action of governments and trust of retailers. It is important to recognize the differences that exist among different crops growers and locations. Attempt needs to bridge the gap among crop growers, locations and different stakeholder such as government agencies and retailers to develop policy.
